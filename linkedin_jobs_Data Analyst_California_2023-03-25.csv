Every 1st Friday that's a no-work day at all, called a FriCAY (like vacay). That of course went really well for team happiness + health, so we doubled down + recently declared ourselves an Unlimited PTO organization.

It's a collaborative effort, so it's important we are open + hold each other accountable as well. As such, that takes a lot of self-confidence, communication, and empathy. Sometimes, an idea we had does not pan out, and we have to own that quickly and objectively. Sometimes we have to analyze + challenge client's beliefs or processes, and we have to do so sensitively and vulnerably. Most times, we're kickin' ass and making it fun, and we just have to be humble and never take our wins for granted. What's important to us is that we have good people who care, and are tough on performance but easy on emotion and realize it's all part of the process, and just be committed to doing the best we can with our fellow people every day we're lucky enough to do it.

WHAT YOU’LL DOANALYZE | You are primarily responsible for extracting, organizing, cleaning, combining, modeling, validating, and analyzing data from clients — to support our clients with insights: to find competitive advantages and drive sustainable growth. You leverage data from the platforms our clients use directly as well as various CSVs, Excel files, Statlas.io, Python Notebooks, Google Sheets, and PostGres Databases. You’ll reach beyond CTC’s own data sets into the wider ecommerce world to unite trends, research, and third-party sources from divergent parts into coherent wholes. You utilize Python, Google Sheets, PostGres, Excel and more for these processes.  FRAME | Your job, however, doesn’t start or stop with the analysis. You need to survey the relevant stakeholders to assess the problem, formulate that problem in mathematical terms, find an approach to solving the problem, construct a hypothesis, and test out that approach. You will iterate through this process until you find one or many potential solutions. Through data, you’ll bring CTC’s ecommerce approach to life for different industries, company sizes, and maturity levels.You’ll also need to clearly articulate the “what”, the “why”, and “how.” You will summarize your findings in reports, emails, slide decks, charts, or client meetings that will be used internally within your teams, externally with clients, and publicly in articles or social media posts. You will defend your results, respond to client questions, and explain your analysis in more detail. The end result being both internal and external facing reports, models, processes and visualizations that are well-thought out, well-articulated, and consider broader economic context. FORMALIZE | Lastly, you’ll create a process for fellow data analysts to follow and integrate the knowledge into CTC’s growth teams so that your fellow employees understand what your analysis means, how to use it with CTC clients, how to reuse this analysis in the future, and where are the opportunities for further analysis. Formalizing this knowledge may take the form of internal reports, models, programs, spreadsheets, external articles, social media posts, videos, and more. The result is a healthy business intelligence ecosystem at CTC, where past findings are leveraged in the future and the institutional knowledge grows in breadth and depth. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE Success in Your Day to Day Looks LikeMaintaining, aggregating, and reporting on CTC’s data assets; most notably those involving clients — Statlas, platforms, and spreadsheetsQuerying a variety of databases in order to “tell fascinating truths” that help mid-to-enterprise ecommerce brands growAssisting CTC’s growth teams and clients in the creation of actionable insightsAiding CTC’s marketing in the creation of content across articles, guides, reports, emails, videos, and social. Success in Your First Three to Six Months Looks LikeAssembling the analytical backbones — from both internal and external data sources — of long-form industry, trends, and topical reports.Leading new analytical projects by proposing and testing hypotheses surrounding the ecommerce growth formula and CTC’s core services.Arrange and tell stories with your data so that Education can make use of your valuable insights in “showing off” CTC’s institutional knowledge WHAT YOU’LL BRING TO THE TABLE3+ years of experience with business intelligence and analytics — ecommerce (DTC) and retail preferred.High-level understanding of statistics, databases, queries (SQL, Python, etc.), as well as financial modeling and forecasting.Experience with data visualization tools to tell your data storyExceptional written and verbal communication skills.Ability to collaborate and execute creative strategy across teams.Familiarity with Dropbox, Google Drive, and Calendar; skilled in ASANA or relevant project management software, preferred.Ability to organize, prioritize and manage multiple tasks — short as well as long-term goals — with great attention to detail.An insatiable curiosity, and an inability to leave a problem alone until you’ve found one or many different potential solutions.
